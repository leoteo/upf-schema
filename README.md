upf-schema
==========

An XML schema definition for the Unified Pseudopotential Format 
of the Quantum Espresso suite.

Pseudopotential files can be validated (to some degree)
by any standard XML validator.
E.g. paste the content of the pseudopotential file as well as
the schema upf.xsd on
    http://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html

Furthermore, an XSLT stylesheet can be used to autmatically produce 
a documentation from the XSD using the standard UNIX tool xsltproc.

At the moment I am using the xs3p stylesheet from
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/xs3p/
However, in the long run it will probably much more convenient
to design our own.
